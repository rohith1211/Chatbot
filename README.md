# Chatbot
My first chatbot using flask framework, it has its own vector database and answers the users, Pre trained sentence transformer were used to encode and decode the sentences and store in the vector database.
It has an integrated LLM which takes the prompt and user query to answer, the frontend is mostly html css and js.
